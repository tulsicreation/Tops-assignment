#Private Heap Space: Python has its private heap space to manage memory.
#                    private heap is the storage area for all the data structures and objects.

#Memory Allocation:  When you create an object in Python, the memory manager allocates a block of memory for the object.
#                    This memory includes space for the object's data and any associated metadata.

#Reference Counting: Python uses reference counting as one of the primary mechanisms for memory management.
#                   Each object has a reference count that tracks how many references point to that object. 
#                    When the reference count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is released.

#Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python employs a cyclic garbage collector to deal with reference
#                    cycles(circular references) that reference counting alone cannot handle. This garbage collector
#                    identifies and cleans up objects that are no longer accessible even if their reference count 
#                    is not zero.

#Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of an object can change during runtime.
#                This flexibility requires dynamic memory management to accommodate changes in object size and structure.

#Memory Pools: Python uses a system of memory pools to efficiently allocate memory for small objects.
#              There are separate memory pools for objects of different sizes.
#              This helps reduce memory fragmentation.

#Memory Optimizations: Python includes memory optimization techniques, such as reusing small integers and sharing
#                      references for immutable objects(e.g., strings) to reduce memory overhead.

#Memory Profiling and Analysis: Python provides tools and libraries for memory profiling and analysis, 
#                               such as sys.getsizeof(), which allows you to inspect the memory consumption of objects.

#Manual Memory Management: Python also allows for manual memory management through modules like ctypes or interfacing with external libraries. However, this is not the typical way memory is managed in Python and should be used with caution.

#=Overall, Python's memory management is designed to strike a balance between efficiency and ease of use. The automatic memory management features, such as reference counting and garbage collection, make it convenient for developers to work with Python without needing to manage memory explicitly, but they also add a small amount of overhead to program execution.
