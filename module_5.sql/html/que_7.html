<!--Inline CSS:
        Inline CSS is applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute. It's used for styling a
        single element and is not recommended for large-scale styling due to its lack of reusability.
Internal CSS:
        Internal CSS is defined within the HTML document's <style>
        element in the <head> section. It applies styles to elements within that HTML file.
External CSS:
         External CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> element 
         in the <head> section. This is the most common method for styling a website as it allows for reusability 
         and separation of concerns.
