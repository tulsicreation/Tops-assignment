# Q-1: What is List? How will you reverse a list?

# ans:
# In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas.
# Reverse Array using the reversed() and reverse() built-in function.
# Using reversed() we can reverse the list and a list_reverseiterator object is created,
# from which we can create a list using list() type casting.
# Or, we can also use the list reverse() function to reverse list in place.
