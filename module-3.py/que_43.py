# Q-43: Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

# ans:
# The zip() function in Python is used to combine two or more iterable dictionaries into a single iterable,
# where corresponding elements from the input iterable are paired together as tuples.
# When using zip() with dictionaries,
# it pairs the keys and values of the dictionaries based on their position in the dictionary.
