# Q-18: What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

# ans:

# tuple means:
# Python tuples are a type of data structure that is very similar to lists.
# The main difference between the two is that tuples are immutable,
# meaning they cannot be changed once they are created.
# This makes them ideal for storing data that should not be modified, such as database records.

# LIST:
# 1.Lists are mutable.
# 2.The implication of iterations is Time-consuming.
# 3.The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
# 4.Lists consume more memory.
# 5.Lists have several built-in methods.
# 6.Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur.

# TUPLE:
# 1.Tuples are immutable.
# 2.The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster.
# 3.A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements.
# 4.Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list.
# 5.Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
# 6.In a tuple, it is hard to take place.
