Que----What are examples of object-oriented programming languages?
Ans----While Simula is credited as being the first object-oriented programming language, many other
       programming languages are used with OOP today.
     --But some programming languages pair with OOP better than others. For example, programming 
       languages considered pure OOP languages treat everything as objects.
     --Other programming languages are designed primarily for OOP, but with some procedural processes 
       included.

---For example, popular pure OOP languages include:

-Ruby
-Scala
-JADE
-Emerald

---Programming languages designed primarily for OOP include:

-Java
-Python
-C++

---Other programming languages that pair with OOP include:
