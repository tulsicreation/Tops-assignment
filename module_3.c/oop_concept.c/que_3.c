Que-----What are the main principles of OOP?
Ans-----Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:

Encapsulation. 
---This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and 
   only select information is exposed. 
---The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. 
 --Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes.
 --They are only able to call a list of public functions or methods.
 --This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data
   corruption.
Abstraction. 
---Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects,
   hiding any unnecessary implementation code.
 --The derived class can have its functionality extended.
 --This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.
Inheritance.
---Classes can reuse code from other classes. 
 --Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common
   logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.
 --This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis,reduces development time and ensures a 
   higher level of accuracy.
Polymorphism.
---Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form.
 --The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object 
   from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code.
 --A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class.
 --Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
