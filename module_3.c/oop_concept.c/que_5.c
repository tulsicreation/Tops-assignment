Que---What are the benefits of OOP?
------Benefits of OOP include:

---Modularity. Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier.

---Reusability. Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same
                code multiple times.
---Productivity. Programmers can construct new programs quicker through the use of multiple libraries 
                 and reusable code.
---Easily upgradable and scalable. Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
---Interface descriptions. Descriptions of external systems are simple, due to message passing 
                           techniques that are used for objects communication.
---Security. Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier
             and internet protocols are protected.
---Flexibility. Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in.
                Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
