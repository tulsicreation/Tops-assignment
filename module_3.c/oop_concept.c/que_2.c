Que----What is the structure of object-oriented programming?
Ans----The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

-----Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects,attributes 
     and methods.
-----Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
     Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
     When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.
-----Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.
     Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. 
     Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods.
     Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at
     a time.
-----Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object.
     Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. 
     Class attributes belong to the class itself.
