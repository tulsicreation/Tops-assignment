QUE---1---What is object-oriented programming?
Ans---Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software designe
      around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object 
      can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

------OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required
      to manipulate them.
 -----This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large,
      complex and actively updated or maintained. 
 -----This includes programs for manufacturing and design,
      as well as mobile applications; for example,
      OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

------The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative
      development, where projects are divided into groups.
      Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

------The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and
      identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise known as data modeling.

------Examples of an object can range from physical entities,
      such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address,
      to small computer programs, such as widgets.

------Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it 
      contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it.
      Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. 
      Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.
